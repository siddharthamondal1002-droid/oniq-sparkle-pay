# OQCA — prove the benchmark's honesty controls by MUTATION. Every claim this
# subsystem makes is a claim about a NUMBER, so the only thing worth guarding is
# whether a test would notice the number changing. Each block breaks one control
# the way a careless edit would, runs the tests in front of it, expects RED, and
# restores the file. GREEN means the control can be removed without a test
# noticing. NOTAPPLIED means the anchor went stale and NOTHING was mutated,
# which is not a verdict (health-mutate-guards.sh learned that 2026-09-09 and
# health-mutate-describe.sh learned it again 2026-09-10).
#
#   scripts/oqca-mutate.sh
#
# The mutations that matter most are the ones that would make OQCA look BETTER
# than it is: a fixture that no longer isolates the phase (M1), a suite whose
# divergence is no longer confined to one row (M2), and the drain defect the
# spec's own operator carries (M5). A benchmark that cannot be caught flattering
# its subject is not a benchmark.
#
# Read-only for the repo: every file is restored from a copy.
